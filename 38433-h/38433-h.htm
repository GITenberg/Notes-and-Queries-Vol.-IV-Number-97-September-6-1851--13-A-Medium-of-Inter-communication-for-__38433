<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, NO. II.&mdash;GABRIEL HARVEY.</span></h3>

<p>This learned friend of Spenser and Sir Philip Sydney (though better
known from his quarrel with Tom Nashe) was in the habit of writing
copious memoranda in his books, several of which were in the library of
Mr. Lloyd, of Wygfair. Among them some miscellaneous volumes, which I
believe afterwards passed into the collection of Mr. Heber, contained
remarkable specimens of his calligraphic skill. His name was written
four or five times: "Gabriel Harveins, 1579," and with variation,
"Gabrielis Harveij" and "di Gabriello Haveio." The volumes contained the
Medea and Giocasta of Lodovico Dolce, in Italian; the Hecuba and
Iphigenia of Euripides in Latin, by Erasmus, the Comedies of Terence,
&amp;c.; and the first Italian and English Grammar, by Henry Grantham, 1575.
On the blank pages and spaces what follows was inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "La Giocasta d' Euripide, Dolce, et Gascoigno. Senecæ et Statii
  Thebais. Item Senecæ &OElig;dipus. Quasi Synopsis
  Trag&oelig;diarum omnium.&mdash;N<span class="smcap lowercase">ON GIOCO, MA</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">IOCASTA.</span>"</p>

<p class="blockquot">      "Omne genus scripti, gravitate Trag&oelig;dia vincit."</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Hæ quatuor Trag&oelig;diæ, instar omnium Trag&oelig;diarum pro
   tempore: præsertim cum reliquarum non suppetit copia. Duæ
   Euripidis placent in primis, et propter auctoris prudentissimam
   veram, et propter interpretis singularem delectum. Eadem in
   Sophoclis Antigonem affectio, ab Episcopo Vatsono tralatam: cum
   propter interpretis accuratum judicium. Qui tanti fecit optimo
   Tragicos, ut eosdem soleret cum Checo et Aschamo, omnibus aliis
   poetis anteferre; etiam Homero et Virgilio."</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Questa Medea di Dolce non è Medea di Seneca. Ma Thieste di Dolce
   è Thieste medesimo di Seneca. Solo coro nel fin è soperchievole."</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Gascoigni Jocasta, magnifice acta solemne ritu, et vere tragico
   apparatu. Ut etiam Vatsoni Antigone; cuive pompæ seriæ, et
   exquisita. Usque adeo quidem utraque ut nihil in hoc tragico
   genere vel illustrius vel accuratius."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Jam floruerant prudentissimi Attici, Pericles, Thucydides,
   Sophocles; jam florent Plato, Xenophon, Demosthenes, cum
   Euripides pangit Trag&oelig;dias. Nec excellentissimorum Atticorum,
   ullus vel prudentior Euripides, vel argutior, vel etiam
   elegantior. Nihil in eo nugarum, nihil affectationis, et tamen
   singula ubique cultissima."</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Erasmus talis Euripidis interpres, qualis Pindari Melancthon.
   F&oelig;lix utriusque ad interpretandum dexteritas et fluens
   elocutionis facilitas. Plus in Erasmo diligentiæ; in Melancthone
   perspicuitas. Quam persequebatur, Camerarius, nec tamen
   assequebatur."</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Erasmi ferè jadicium acre, et serium nec dubium est, quin
   delectum adhibucrit in sapientissimis Trag&oelig;diis eligendis
   exquisitum."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Ut ferè f&oelig;minas; sic Com&oelig;dias et Trag&oelig;dias; qui unam

<p>I thought these notes worth transcribing, not only as showing the
attention paid by the learned students of this time to <i>the drama</i>, as
well ancient as modern, but more especially for the mention made of the
<i>Jocasta</i> of George Gascoigne, and the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles,
translated, as he says, by Watson, Bishop of Worcester, and not by
Thomas Watson, as Warton supposed. It may be doubted whether this
translation was into English; but Harvey seems to imply that it was
acted, as well as the Jocasta. Bishop Watson was celebrated for his
dramatic skill, in his Latin tragedy of <i>Absalon</i>, by Roger Ascham, who
says,&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "When M. Watson, in St. John's College at Cambridge, wrote his
   excellent Tragedie of Absalon, M. Cheke, he, and I, had many
   pleasant talkes togither, in comparing the preceptes of Aristotle
   and Horace with the examples of Euripides, Sophocles, and
   Seneca.... M. Watson had another maner of care of perfection,
   with a feare and reverence of the judgement of the best learned:
   who to this day would neuer suffer yet his Absalon to go abroad,
   and that onelie bicause (<i>in locis paribus</i>) <i>Anapæstus</i> is twise
   or thrise used instead of <i>Iambus</i>."</p>

<p>In a volume in the Bodleian Library marked Z. 3., Art. "Selden," is "The
Life of Howleglas," printed by Copland: at the bottom of the last page
is the following MS. note:</p>


 <p class="blockquot">  "This Howleglasse, with Scoggin, Skelton, and (L&mdash;&mdash;zario&mdash;&mdash;?)
   given me at London of M. Spenser, xx Decembris, 1578, on
   condition y<span class="topnum">t</span> I shoold bestowe y<span class="topnum">e</span> readinge on them, on or before
   y<span class="topnum">e</span> first day of January immediately ensuinge: otherwise to

   wherein methought y<span class="topnum">t</span> not all fower together seemed comparable
   for fine and crafty feates with Jon Miller, whose witty shiftes
   and practises are reported among Skelton's Tales."</p>

<p>Mr. Malone, from whose memoranda I copy this, says, "I suspect it is
Gabriel Harvey's handwriting."</p>

<p>I have a copy of the Organon of Aristotle in Greek, which bears marks of
Gabriel Harvey's diligent scholarship. It is copiously annotated and
analysed by him when a student at Cambridge, and he has registered the
periods at which he completed the study of each part.</p>

<h3><span>THE ANTIQUITY OF KILTS.</span></h3>

<p>This has been the subject of many discussions, and has recently found a
place in the columns of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." I do not propose to take
any part in the present discussion, but it may be of some service to

 introduce to public notice a much
older authority than any that has yet been cited.</p>

<p>It is known to but few antiquaries out of the principality, that the
ancient poetry of Wales throws more light on the immediate post-Roman
history of Britain than any documents in existence. These poems vividly
pourtray the social condition of the period, and contain almost the only
records of the great contest between the natives and the Saxon invaders;
they prove beyond a doubt that the Romans had left the province in an
advanced stage of civilisation, and they supply us with the means of
affirming decisively, that the vine was cultivated here to a very
considerable extent.</p>

<p>The antiquity of these poems admits of no reasonable doubt; on that
point the <i>Vindication</i> of Turner enables the antiquaries of Wales to
make this assertion with confidence: and having recently translated most
of our old poems, with a view to future publication, I feel myself
warranted in assuming them to belong to the sixth and seventh centuries
of our era. One of these bards, Aneurin by name, belonged to the British
tribe, described by the Romans as Ottadini, and by themselves as the
people of Gododin. This people were situated at the junction of England
and Scotland, and the poems of this bard chiefly refer to that district;
but as the bards were a rambling class, and as the bulk of the people
from Chester to Dumbarton were the same race as the people of the
principality, we are not surprised when we find this bard sometimes
among "the banks and braes of bonny Doon," and sometimes in North and
South Wales. In one of his verses he thus describes the kilt of a
British chief:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
 <p> "Peis dinogat e vreith vreith</p>
      <p>O grwyn balaot ban ureith."</p>
</div>

<p>These lines may be found in the <i>Myvyrian Archæology</i>, vol. i. p. 13.
col. 1.; and a most unwarrantable translation of <i>dinogat</i> may be found
in Davies' <i>Mythology of the Druids</i>; but the literal rendering would be
this:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "Dinogad's kilt is stripy, stripy,</p>
      <p>Of the skins of front-streak'd wolf-cubs."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Peis</i> or <i>pais</i> is the word now used for the article of female attire
known as a petti-coat, which in form bears a sufficiently close
resemblance to the male kilt to justify me in using that word here. It
also occurs in <i>pais-arfau</i>, a coat of arms, and <i>pais-ddur</i>, a coat of
mail. The words <i>vreith vreith</i> have been translated word for word; in
the Kymric language it is a very common form of emphatic expression to
repeat the word on which the emphasis falls, as <i>yn dda da</i> for <i>very
good</i>; but a more idiomatic translation would have been, <i>very stripy</i>.
<i>Vraith</i> with us also stands for plaid, and in the Welsh Bible Joseph's
"coat of many colours" is named <i>siacced vraith</i>.</p>

<p>Now I will not attempt to determine what relation this kilt stands in to
the kilts of the Highlands, whether the Gael borrowed it from the
Briton, or the Briton from the Gael, or whether the dress was common to
both at the time in which Dinogad lived; but thus much appears to be
clear, that we here have a <i>kilt</i>, and that that kilt was striped, if
not a <i>plaid</i>; and it only remains for us to determine the period at
which Dinogad lived. Most persons are acquainted with the name of
Brochmael, Prince of Powys, the British commander at the battle of
Bangor in 613, on the occasion of the dispute between Augustine and the
primitive British church; Dinogad stood to him in the following
relation:</p>

<table summary="Dinogad">

<tr><td></td><td colspan="3" class="tdcenter">B<span class="smcap lowercase">ROCHMAEL</span></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td colspan="3" class="tdcenter">   |</td><td></td></tr>

</table>

<p>Of Dinogad himself there is but one fact on record, and that took place
in 577. His brother Selyf fell at the battle of Bangor or Chester in
613. If we take these facts together, we may form a pretty accurate idea
respecting the period at which he lived.</p>

<p>Viewing this matter from a Cambrian standpoint, I feel myself warranted
in hazarding the following remarks. In the lines of Aneurin, the thing
selected for special notice is the excess of stripe; and therefore,
whether it was the invention of Dinogad, or whether he borrowed the idea
from the Scots or Picts when he was at Dumbarton in 577, it is quite
clear, from the repetition of the word <i>vreith</i>, that his kilt had the
attribute of stripyness to a greater extent than was usually the case;
while it is also equally clear, that amongst the Britons of that period,
kilts of a stripy character were so common as to excite no surprise. We
may therefore affirm,</p>

<p>1. That in the beginning of the seventh century the British chiefs were
in the habit of wearing skin kilts.</p>

<p>2. That striped kilts were common.</p>

<p>3. That a chief named Dinogad was distinguished by an excess of this
kind of ornament. And</p>

<p>4. That as the Kymry of North Britain were on intimate terms with their
neighbours, it is highly probable that the Scottish kilt is much older
than 1597.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON JULIN, NO. 1.<br />
(Vol. ii., pp. 230. 282. 379. 443.)</span></h3>

<p>In approaching a subject set at rest so long since, I feel some apology
due to you; and that apology I will make by giving you the results of my
recent investigation of the question of Vineta
<a id="Vineta172"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[172]</span>
 <i>v.</i> Julin <i>alias</i>
Wollin, made in Pomerania, and noted from personal testimony and
Pomeranian chronicles.</p>

<p>But, first, to correct an <i>erreur de plume</i> of D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ELL'S</span>. He says, in
stating the position of Vineta (Vol. ii., p. 283.), "opposite the small
town of <i>Demmin, in Pomerania</i>." D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ELL</span> has mis-written the name:
there is no such place on the Baltic. The real name is <i>Damerow, on the
Isle of Usedom</i>. A little lower he remarks, speaking of Wollin, "No
<i>rudera</i>, no vestiges of ancient grandeur, now mark the spot; not even a
tradition of former greatness." In this I think D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ELL</span> will find (and,
I am sure, will readily allow, in the same spirit of good faith in which
I make my observations) that he is in error, from the following
narrative.</p>

<p>The gentleman who has kindly given me, by word of mouth, the following
particulars, is a native of Wollin, and of one of the most ancient and
noble families in that island, a relative of that Baron Kaiserling who
was the Cicero of Frederick the Great, but of an elder branch of that
family, the Counts of Kaiserling. M. de Kaiserling states that, when a
young man, in his native town, he took a delight in reading the records
of its bygone glory, and in tracing out the ruins in the neighbourhood
of the town, extending to the distance of about one English mile from
its outskirts. The foundations of houses and tracks of streets<a id="streets1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are
still exposed in the operations of agriculture, and any informant has in
his possession several Byzantine and Wendish coins which he at that time
picked up. He has likewise seen a Persian coin, which was found in the
same neighbourhood by a friend. Having been led by circumstances to
examine the evidence <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i> in this question, he has come to
the conclusion that Wollin and Julin or Jumne are identical. He treats
the story of Vineta as a nursery tale and a myth.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#streets1" class="label">[1]</a> Particularly the Salmarks (Wendish for Fishmarkets), as
they were called.</p>

<p>From the recently-published work on Wollin (<i>Die Insel Wollin und das
Seebad Misdroy. Historische Skizze von Georg Wilhelm von Raumer</i>:
Berlin, 1851) I extract the following account of Wollin in 1070, as I
think it important to have all the best evidence attainable:<a id="able2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> &mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Adam of Bremen, a contemporaneous historian, has left us a
   curious description of Wollin as it appeared at the time of its
   merchant greatness; yet he was himself, most probably, never
   there, but compiled his account from the narratives of sailors,
   from whose mouth he, as he says, heard almost incredibilities
   about the splendour of the town. He describes the famous city as
   the chief staple place of the trade of the surrounding Slavonians
   and Russians: also as the largest of all towns at this end of
   Europe, and inhabited by Slavonians, Russians, and various pagan
   nations. Also many Germans from Lower Saxony had come to the
   town, yet it was not permitted them to appear openly as
   Christians; though the political interests of a trading place,
   then as now, caused all nations to be allowed the liberty of
   incolation (<i>Niederlassungsrecht</i>) and toleration. The peculiar
   inhabitants of the place, particularly those who held the
   government, were mostly pagans, but of great hospitality, of
   liberal and humane customs, and great justice. The town had
   become very rich, by means of the trade of Northern Europe, of
   which they had almost the monopoly: every comfort and rarity of
   distant regions was to be found there. The most remarkable thing
   in Wollin was a pot of Vulcan, which the inhabitants called Greek
   fire.<a id="fire3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Probably we should understand by this, a great beacon
   fire, which the Wolliners sustained by night on account of
   navigation, and of which a report was among the sailors that it
   was Greek fire; but it is also possible that in the trade with
   the Orient, which the discovered Arabic coins prove, real Greek
   fire was brought to Wollin in pots. A tricaputed idol of a
   sea-god, or Neptune, stood in Wollin, to denote that the island
   Wollin was surrounded by three different seas: that is to say, a
   green one, the Ostsee; a white one, under which we should
   probably understand the Dievenow; and one which was retained in
   raging motion by continual storms, the Haff. The navigation from
   Wollin to Demmin, a trading place of the Peene, is short; also
   from Wollin to Samland, in Prussia, eight days only were
   necessary to go by land from Hamburgh to Wollin, or by sea,
   across Schleswig; and forty-three days was the time of sailing
   from Wollin to Ostragard in Russia. These notices point to the
   chief trade of Wollin by sea, that is, with Demmin, Hamburgh,
   Schleswig, and Holstein, Prussia, and Russia.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"So magnificent was ancient Wollin, according to the narrative of
   the seamen; yet it must not be considered exactly a northern
   Venice, but a wide-circuited place, chiefly, however, of wooden
   houses, and surrounded by walls and palisades, in which (in
   comparison with the then rudeness and poverty of the countries on
   the Ostsee) riches and merchandise were heaped up.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "And now it is time to mention the fable of the drowned city
   Vineta. While an old chronicler, Helmold, follows Adam of Bremen
   in the description of the city Wollin, he puts, through an error
   of transcription,<a id="script4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>  in place of Julinum or Jumne, which name
   Adam of Bremen has, Vineta; such a place could not be found, and
   it was concluded, therefore, that the sea had engulfed it. The
   celebrated Buggenhagen<a id="hagen5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> first discovered, in the beginning of
   the sixteenth century, a great rock formation in the sea, at the
   foot of the Streckelberg, on the island of Usedom,<a id="Usedom6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and then
   the
<a id="city173"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[173]</span>
 city Vineta was soon transplanted thither; and it was
   absurdly considered that a rock reef (which has lately been used
   for the harbour of Swinemünde, and has disappeared) was the ruins
   of a city destroyed by the waves a thousand years ago: indeed,
   people are not wanting at the present day, who hold fast to this
   fable, caused by the error of a transcriber. In the mean time it
   has become a folk tale, and as such retains its value. A Wolliner
   booth-keeper recounted me the interesting story, which may be
   read in Barthold's <i>History of Pomerania</i> (vol. i. p. 419.),&mdash;a
   rough sterling Pomeranian (<i>ächt-pommerschis</i>) fantastical
   picture of the overbearing of the trade-enriched inhabitants of
   Vineta, which God had so punished by sending the waves of the
   ocean over the city. The town of Wollin, to which alone this
   legend was applicable, is certainly not destroyed by the sea, nor
   wholly desert: but if they deserved punishment for their pride in
   their greatness, they had received it in that they had quite
   fallen from their former glory."&mdash;Pp. 22-25.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#able2" class="label">[2]</a> Likewise, repetition must be excused, as it is here
scarcely avoidable.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#fire3" class="label">[3]</a> "Olla Vulcani quæ incolæ Græcam vocant ignem de quo etiam
meminit Solinus," adds Adam of Bremen. Solinus speaks of oil, or rather
naphtha, from M&oelig;sia; and it is not improbable that the Wolliners
imported it for their beacons in pots.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#script4" class="label">[4]</a> The oldest MSS. are said not to have this error.</p>

<p>As I wish thoroughly to dispose of the question, I shall divide my
communication on Julin into two parts, of which the above is the first.
I reserve my own remarks till all the evidence has been heard.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Anecdote of Curran.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;During one of the circuits, Curran was dining
with a brother advocate at a small inn kept by a respectable woman, who,
to the well ordering of her establishment, added a reputation for that
species of apt and keen reply, which sometimes supplies the place of
wit. The dinner had been well served, the wine was pronounced excellent,
and it was proposed that the hostess should be summoned to receive their
compliments on her good fare. The Christian name of this purveyor was
Honoria, a name of common occurrence in Ireland, but which is generally
abbreviated to that of Honor. Her attendance was prompt, and Curran,
after a brief eulogium on the dinner, but especially the wine, filled a
bumper, and, handing it, proposed as a toast, "Honor and Honesty." His
auditor took the glass, and with a peculiarly arch smile, said, "Our
absent friends," and having drank off her amended toast, she curtseyed
and withdrew.</p>

<h4><span><i>Difficulty of getting rid of a Name.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The institution founded in Gower
Street under the name of the <i>University of London</i>, lived for ten years
under that name, and, since, for fifteen years, under the name of
<i>University College</i>, a new institution receiving the name of the
<i>University of London</i>. A few years after the change of name, a donor
left reversionary property to the <i>London University in Gower Street</i>,
which made it necessary to obtain the assistance of the Court of
Chancery in securing the reversion to its intended owners. A professor
of the <i>College</i> in Gower Street received a letter, dated from Somerset
House (where the <i>University</i> is), written by the Vice-Chancellor of the
University himself, and addressed, not to the <i>University College</i>, but
to the <i>University of London</i>. And in a public decision, by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, as Visitor of Dulwich College, which appears
in <i>The Times</i> of July 21, it is directed that certain scholars are to
proceed for instruction to some such place as "King's College or <i>the
London University</i>." This is all worthy of note, because we often appeal
to old changes of name in the settlement of dates. When this decision
becomes very old, it may happen that its date will be brought into doubt
by appeal to the fact that the place of <i>instruction</i> (what is <i>now</i> the
<i>University</i> giving no instruction but only granting degrees, and to
students of King's College among others) ceased to have the title of
<i>University</i> in 1837. What so natural as to argue that the Archbishop,
himself a visitor of King's College, cannot have failed to remember
this. A reflected doubt may be thrown upon some arguments relating to
dates in former times.</p>

<h4><span><i>House of Lord Edward Fitzgerald.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The Note on his mother, in Vol.
iii., p. 492., reminds me of making the following one on himself, which
may be worth a place in your columns. When lately passing through the
village of Harold's Cross, near Dublin, a friend pointed out to me a
high antiquated-looking house in the village, which he said had been
occupied by Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and in which he had planned many of
his designs. The house appears to be in good preservation, and is still
occupied.</p>

<h4><span><i>Fairy Dances.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It might perhaps throw some light on this fanciful
subject, were we to view it in connexion with the operation of the
phenomenon termed the "odylic light," emitted from magnetic substances.
The Baron von Riechenbach, in his <i>Researches on Magnetism, &amp;c.</i>,
explains the cause of somewhat similar extraordinary appearances in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "High on the Brocken there are rocky summits which are strongly
   magnetic, and cause the needle to deviate: these rocks contain
   disseminated magnetic iron ore; ... the necessary consequence is
   that they send up odylic flames.... Who could blame persons
   imbued with the superstitious feelings of their age, if they saw,
   under these circumstances, the devil dancing with his whole train
   of ghosts, demons, and witches? The revels of the Walpurgisnacht
   must now, alas! vanish, and give place to the sobrieties of
   science&mdash;science, which with her touch dissipates one by one all
   the beautiful but dim forms evoked by phantasy."</p>

<p>Should such a thing as the odylic light satisfactorily explain the
phenomenon of ghosts, fairies, &amp;c., we should happily be relieved from
the awkward necessity of continuing to treat their
<a id="existence174"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[174]</span>
 existence as
"old wives' fables," or the production of a disordered imagination.</p>

<p class="right">    J. H. K<span class="smcap lowercase">ERSHAW</span>.</p>




<h4><span><i>Æsop.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It may be said, at first sight, "Why, every body knows all
about him." I answer, Perhaps about as much as modern painters and
artists know about Bacchus, whom they always represent as a gross,
vulgar, fat person: all the ancient poets, however (and surely they
ought to know best), depict him an exquisitely beautiful youth. A
similar vulgar error exists with regard to Æsop, who in the
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> is pronounced a strikingly deformed personage.
The exact opposite seems to have been the truth. Philostratus has left a
description of a picture of Æsop, who was represented with a chorus of
animals about him: he was painted smiling, and looking thoughtfully on
the ground, but not a word is said of any deformity. Again, the
Athenians erected a statue to his honour, "and," says Bentley, "a statue
of him, if he were deformed, would only have been a monument of his
ugliness: it would have been an indignity, rather than an honour to his
memory, to have perpetuated his deformity."</p>

<p>And, lastly, he was sold into Samos by a slave-dealer, and it is a
well-known fact that these people bought up the handsomest youths they
could procure.</p>

<h4><span><i>Nelson's Coat at Trafalgar</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv. p. 114.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Besides the loss of
bullion from one of the epaulettes of Lord Nelson's coat occasioned by
the circumstance related by Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span>, there was a similar defacement
caused by the fatal bullet itself, which might render the identification
suggested by ÆGROTUS a little difficult. Sir W. Beatty says, in his
<i>Authentic Narrative of the Death of Lord Nelson</i>, p. 70.:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The ball struck the fore part of his lordship's epaulette, and
   entered the left shoulder.... On removing the ball, a portion of
   the gold lace and pad of the epaulette, together with a small
   piece of his lordship's coat, was found firmly attached to it."</p>

<p>The ball, with the adhering gold lace, &amp;c., was set in a crystal locket,
and worn by Sir W. Beatty. It is now, I believe, in the possession of
Prince Albert.</p>

<p>The intention of my note (Vol. iii., p. 517.) was to refute a common
impression, probably derived from Harrison's work, that Lord Nelson had
rashly adorned his admiral's uniform with extra insignia on the day of
the battle, and thereby rendered himself a conspicuous object for the
French riflemen.</p>

<h2><span class="bla">Queries.</span></h2>


<h3><span>JOHN KNOX.</span></h3>

<p>In completing the proposed series of Knox's writings, I should feel
greatly indebted to D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">AITLAND</span> or any of your readers for answering
the following Queries:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In the Catalogue of writers on the Old and New Testament, p. 107.:
London, 1663, a sermon on Ezechiel ix. 4., attributed to Knox, is said
to have been printed anno 1580. Where is there a copy of this sermon
preserved?</p>

<p>2. Bale, and Melchior Adam, copying Verheiden, include in the list of
Knox's writings, <i>In Genesim Conciones</i>. Is such a book known to exist?</p>

<p>3. Bishop Tanner also ascribes to him <i>Exposition on Daniel</i>: Malburg,
1529. This date is unquestionably erroneous, and probably the book also.</p>

<p>4. Knox's elaborate treatise <i>Against the Adversaries of God's
Predestination</i> was first published at Geneva, 1560, by John Crespin.
Toby Cooke, in 1580, had a license to print Knoxes <i>Answere to the
Cauillations of ane Anabaptist</i>. (Herbert's <i>Ames</i>, p. 1263.) Is there
any evidence that the work was reprinted earlier than 1591?</p>

<p>5. The work itself professes to be in answer to a book entitled <i>The
Confutation of the Errors of the Careles by Necessitie</i>; "which book,"
it is added, "written in the English tongue, doeth contain as well the
lies and blasphemies imagined by Sebastian Castalio, ... as also the
vane reasons of Pighius, Sadoletus, and Georgius Siculus, pestilent
Papistes, and expressed enemies of God's free mercies." When was this
<i>Confutation</i> printed, and where is there a copy to be seen?</p>

<h4><span>117. <i>Cornish Arms and Cornish Motto.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The Cornish arms are a field
sable with fifteen <i>bezants</i>, not <i>balls</i> as they are commonly called,
5. 4. 3. 2. 1. in pale <i>or</i>. These arms were borne by Condurus, the last
Earl of Cornwall of British blood, in the time of William I., and were
so borne until Richard, Earl of Cornwall, on being created Earl of
Poictou, took the arms of such. According to the custom of the French,
these were a rampant lion <i>gules</i> crowned <i>or</i>, in a field <i>argent</i>; but
to show forth Cornwall, he threw the fifteen <i>bezants</i> into a bordour
<i>sable</i>, round the bearing of the Earl of Poictou; but the Cornish arms,
those of Condurus, are unaltered, though the <i>coins</i> are often mistaken
for balls, and painted on a field coloured to the painter's fancy. Can
you tell me when the Cornish motto "one and all" was adopted, and why?

<h4><span>118. <i>Gloucester saved from the King's Mines.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In Sir Kenelm Digby's
<i>Treatise of Bodies</i>, ch. xxviii. sec. 4., is this passage:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The trampling of men and horses in a quiet night, will be heard
   some miles off.... Most of all if one set a drum smooth upon the
   ground, and lay one's ear to the upper edge of it," &amp;c.</p>

<p>On which the copy in my possession (ed. 1669) has the following marginal
note in a cotemporary hand:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Thus Gloucester was saved from the King's mines by y<span class="topnum">e</span> drum of a
   drunken dru&#773;mer."</p>

<p>To what event does this refer, and where shall I find an account of it?
It evidently happened during the civil wars, but Clarendon has no
mention of it.</p>

we are informed that he prepared for the press a "Fasciculus Plantarum

and Galway, written in Latin, with the English and Irish names of each
plant. See also <i>Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science</i>, i.&mdash;xxx.

<p>Can any of your readers refer me to similar lists of plants indigenous
to either England or Ireland, in which the provincial names are
preserved, with any notes on their use in medicine, or their connexion

<h4><span>127. <i>Nightingale and Thorn.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Where is the earliest notice of the fable
of the nightingale and the thorn? that she sings because she has a thorn
in her breast? For obvious reasons, the fiction cannot be classical.</p>

<p>It is noticed by Byron:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,</p>
     <p> That fable places in her breast of wail,</p>
     <p> Is lighter far of heart and voice than those</p>
     <p> Whose headlong passions form their proper woes."</p>
</div>

<p>But an earlier mention is found in Browne's poem on the death of Mr.
Thomas Manwood:&mdash;</p>


     <div class="poem">
  <p>"Not for thee these briny tears are spent,</p>
        <p class="i3">But as the nightingale against the breere,</p>
     <p> 'Tis for myself I moan and do lament,</p>
        <p class="i3">Not that thou left'st the world, but left'st me here."</p>
</div>

<p>He seems to interpret the fable to the same effect as Homer makes
Achilles' women lament Patroclus&mdash;<span title="[Greek: Patroklou prophasin, sphôn d'
autôn kêde' hekastê.]">&#928;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8057;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#965;

the afflicted,&mdash;a comfortable doctrine to prosaic and unmusical people.</p>

Hexham) which is in Holinshed, (the third volume of <i>Chronicles</i>, fol.
Lond. 1577, p. 666. col. 2. line 28.): but this appears to be copied
from Grafton (<i>A Chronicle, &amp;c.</i>, fol. Lond. 1569), where the word
stands <i>Abococket</i>. If this author took it from Hall (<i>The Union, &amp;c.</i>,
fol. Lond. 1549) I think it there stands the same: but in Fabyan's
<i>Chronicle</i>, as edited by Ellis, it is printed <i>Bycoket</i>; and in one
black-letter copy in the British Museum, it may be seen <i>Bicoket</i>,
corrected in the margin by a hand of the sixteenth century, <i>Brioket</i>.</p>

<h3><span>PENDULUM DEMONSTRATION OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 129.)</span></h3>

<p>I beg to send you a few remarks on the note of A. E. B., concerning the
"Pendulum Demonstration of the Earth's Rotation."</p>

<p>Your correspondent appears to consider that the only fact asserted by
the propounders of the theory, is a variation in the plane of
oscillation, caused by "the difference of rotation due to the excess of
velocity with which one extremity of the line of oscillation may be
affected more than the other;" the probable existence of which he proves
by imagining a pendulum suspended over a point half-way between London
and Edinburgh, and set in motion by being drawn towards and retained
over London, and thence dismissed on its course. It is clear that in
such a case the pendulum would at starting be impressed with the same
velocity of motion in an eastern direction which the retaining power in
London had, and that its path would be the result of this force
compounded with that given by gravity in its line of suspension, <i>i.e.</i>
towards the north, and its course would therefore be one subject to easy
calculation. I should imagine that this disturbing force arising from
the excess of eastern velocity possessed by the starting point over that
of suspension, would be inappreciable after a few oscillations; but at
all events it is evident that it might readily be avoided by setting the
pendulum in motion by an impulse given beneath the point of suspension,
by giving to it a direction east and west as suggested by A. E. B., or
by several other expedients which must occur to a mathematician.</p>

<p>Your correspondent proceeds by requiring that there should be shown
"reasonable ground to induce the belief that the ball is really free
from the attraction of each successive point of the earth's surface,"
and is not as "effectually a partaker in the rotation of any given
point" as if it were fixed there; or that "the duration of residence"
necessary to cause such effect should be stated. Now I certainly am
aware of no force by which a body unconnected with the earth would have
any tendency to rotate with it; gravity can only act in a direct line
from the body affected to the centre of the attracting body, and the
motion in the direction of the earth's rotation can only be gained by
contact or connexion, however momentary, with it. The onus of proving
the existence of such a force as A. E. B. alludes to, must surely rest
with him, not that of disproving it with me. What the propounders of
this theory claim to show is, I humbly conceive, this,&mdash;that the
direction in which a pendulum oscillates is <i>constant</i>, and not affected
by the rotation of the earth beneath it: that as when suspended above
the pole (where the point of suspension would remain fixed) the plane of
each oscillation would make a <i>different</i> angle with any given meridian
of longitude, returning to its original angle when the diurnal rotation
of the earth was completed; and as when suspended above the equator,
where the point of suspension would be moved in a right line, or, to
define more accurately, where the plane made by the motion of a line
joining the point of suspension and the point directly under it (over
which the ball would remain if at rest) would be a flat or right plane,
the angle made by each successive oscillation with any one meridian
would be the <i>same</i>, so, at all the intermediate stations between the
pole and the equator, where the point of suspension would move in a
line, commencing near the pole with an infinitely small curve, and
ending near the equator with one infinitely large (<i>i.e.</i> where the
plane as described above would be thus curved), the angle of the plane
of oscillation with a given meridian would, at each station, vary in a
ratio diminishing from the variation at the pole until it became extinct
at the equator, which variation they believe to be capable both of
mathematical proof and of ocular demonstration.</p>

<p>I do not profess to be one of the propounders of this theory, and it is
very probable that you may have received from some other source a more
lucid, and perhaps a more correct, explanation of it; but in case you
have not done so, I send you the foregoing rough "Note" of what are my
opinions of it.

<h3><span>A SAXON BELL-HOUSE.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 102.)</span></h3>

<p>Your correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span>, in a late number, has quoted a passage of
the historian Hume, which treats a certain Anglo-Saxon document as a
statute of Athelstan. As your correspondent cites his author without a
comment, he would appear to give his own sanction to the date which Hume
has imposed upon that document. In point of fact, it bears no express
date, and therefore presents a good subject for a Query, whether that or
any other era is by construction applicable to it. It is an extremely
interesting Anglo-Saxon remain; and as it bears for title, "be
leodgethincthum and lage," it purports to give legal information upon
the secular dignities and ranks of the Anglo-Saxon period. This promises
well to the archæologist, but unfortunately, on a nearer inspection, the
document loses much of its worth; for, independently of its lacking a
date, its jurisprudence partakes more of theory than that dry law which
we might imagine would proceed from the Anglo-Saxon bench.
Notwithstanding this, however, its archæological interest is great. The
language is pure and incorrupt West Saxon.</p>

<p>It has been published by all its editors (except Professor Leo) as
<i>prose</i>, when it is clearly not only rythmical but alliterative&mdash;an
obvious characteristic of Anglo-Saxon poetry. And it is this mistake
which has involved the further consequence of giving to the document a
legal and historical value which it would never have had if its real
garb had been seen through. This has led the critics into a belief of
its veracity, when a knowledge of its real character would have inspired
doubts. I believe that its accidental position in the first printed
edition at the end of the "Judicia" (whether it be so placed in the MS.
I know not) has assisted in the delusion, and has supplied a date to the
minds of those who prefer faith to disquisition. The internal evidence
of the document also shows that it is not jurisprudence, but only a
vision spun from the writer's own brains, of what he dreamed to be
constitutional and legal characteristics of an anterior age, when there
were greater liberty of action and expansion of mind. The opening words
of themselves contain the character of the document:&mdash;"Hit wæs hwilum."
It is not a narrative of the present, but a record of the past.</p>

<p>The legal poet then breaks freely into the darling ornament of
Anglo-Saxon song, alliteration: "On Engla lagum thæt leod and lagum,"
and so on to the end. As its contents are so well known and accessible,
I will not quote them, but will merely give a running comment upon
parts. "Gif ceorl getheah," &amp;c. It may be <i>doubted</i> whether, even in
occasional instances, the <i>ceorl</i> at any time possessed under the
Anglo-Saxon system the power of equalising himself by means of the
acquisition of property, with the class of theguas or gentils-hommes.
But in the broad way in which the poet states it, it may be absolutely
denied, inasmuch as the acquisition of wealth is made of itself to
transform the <i>ceorl</i> into a <i>thegn</i>: a singular coincidence of idea
with the vulgar modern theory, but incompatible with fact in an age when
a dominant caste of <i>gentlemen</i> obtained.</p>

<p>It is not until the reign of Edward III. that any man, not born a
gentleman, can be distinctly traced in possession of the honours and
dignities of the country; an air of improbability is thus given which is
increased by a verbal scrutiny. In the words "gif thegen getheah thæt be
wearth to eorle," &amp;c., the use of the word <i>eorl</i> is most suspicious.
This is not the <i>eorl</i> of antiquity&mdash;the Teutonic <i>nobilis</i>; it is the
official <i>eorl</i> of the Danish and <i>quasi</i>-Danish periods. This
anachronism betrays the real date of the production, and carries us to
the times succeeding the reign of Ethelred II., when the disordered and
transitional state of the country may have excited in the mind of the
disquieted writer a fond aspiration which he clothed in the fanciful
garb of his own wishes, rather than that of the gloomy reality which he
saw before him.</p>

<p>The use of the <i>cræft</i>, for a vessel, like the modern, is to be found in
the <i>Andreas</i> (v. 500.), a composition probably of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>The conclusion points to troubled and late times of the Anglo-Saxon
rule, when the church missed the reverence which had been paid to it in
periods of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>I have said enough to show that this document cannot rank in accuracy or
truthful value with the Rectitudines or the LL. of Hen. I.</p>

<p>One word more. What is the meaning of <i>burh-geat</i>? <i>Burh</i> I can
understand; authorities abound for its use as expressing the <i>manoir</i> of
the Anglo-Saxon <i>thegn</i>. The "geneates riht" (<i>Rectitudines</i>) is
"bytlian and burh hegegian." The <i>ceorls</i> of Dyddanham were bound to
dyke the hedge of their lords' <i>burh</i> ("Consuetudines in Dyddanhamme,"
<i>Kemb</i>, vol. iii. App. p. 450.): "And dicie gyrde burh heges."</p>

   unluckily fell overboard from a frigate into the Mediterranean. A
   seal (<i>Seehund</i>, not <i>Hai</i>, a shark) immediately took the man,
   swimming and crying for help, into it wide jaws. Other seamen
   sprang into a boat to help their swimming comrade; and their
   captain, noticing the accident, had the presence
<a id="presence179"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[179]</span>
of mind
   to direct a gun to be fired from the deck at the fish, whereby he
   was fortunately so far struck (<i>so getroffen wurde</i>) that he
   <i>spit</i> out directly the seaman previously seized in his jaws, who
   was taken into the boat alive, and apparently little hurt.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The seal was taken by harpoons and ropes, and hauled into the
   frigate, and hung to dry in the cross-trees (<i>quære</i>). The
   captain gave the fish to the seaman who, by God's providence, had
   been so wonderfully preserved; and he made the circuit of Europe
   with it as an exhibition, and from France it came to Erlangen,
   Nuremburg, and other places, where it was openly shown. The fish
   was twenty feet long, with fins nine feet broad, and weighed
   3,924 lbs., and is illustrated in tab. 9. fig. 5.; from all which
   it is very probably concluded, that this kind was the true
   Jonas-fish."</p>

<p>Bochart concurs in this opinion.</p>

<p>Herman de Hardt (<i>Programma de rebus Jonæ</i>, Helmst. 1719) considers that
Jonah stopt at a tavern bearing the sign of the whale.</p>

<p>Lesz (<i>Vermischte Schriften</i>, Th. i. S. 16.) thinks that a ship with a
figure-head (<i>Zeichen</i>) of a whale took Jonah on board, and in three
days put him ashore; from which it was reported that the ship-whale had
vomited (discharged) him.</p>

<p>Eichhorn has noticed the above in his Introduction to the Old Testament
(iii. 250.).</p>

<p>An anonymous writer says that <i>dag</i> means a fish-boat; and that the word
which is translated <i>whale</i>, should have been <i>preserver</i>; a criticism
inconsistent with itself, and void of authority.</p>

<p>The above four instances are the only hypotheses at variance with the
received text and interpretation worthy of notice: if indeed the case of
the shark can be deemed at all at variance, as the term
 <span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>
was used to designate many different fishes.</p>

<p>Jebb (<i>Sacred Literature</i>, p. 178.) says that the whale's stomach is not
a safe and practicable asylum; but&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "The throat is large, and provided with a bag or intestine so
   considerable in size that whales frequently take into it <i>two</i> of
   their young, when weak, especially during a tempest. In this
   vessel there are two vents, which serve for inspiration and
   expiration; there, in all probability, Jonas was preserved."</p>

<p>John Hunter compares the whale's tongue to a feather bed; and says that
the baleen (whalebone) and tongue together fill up the whole space of
the jaws.</p>

<p>Josephus describes the fish of Jonah as a
 <span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;,</span> and fixes on
the Euxine for the locality as an <i>on dit</i>
 <span title="[Greek: ho logos]">(&#8001; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;).</span> The same
word in reference to the same event is used by Epiphanius, Cedrenus,
Zanarus, and Nicephorus.</p>

<p>The Arabic version has the word &#1581;&#1615;&#1608;&#1618;&#1578;&#1575; (<i>choono</i>), translated in
Walton's Polyglott <i>cetus</i>; but the word, according to Castell, means "a
tavern," or "merchants' office." This may have led to Herman de Hardt's
whim.</p>

<p>The Targum of Jonathan, and the Syriac of Jonah, have both the identical
word which was most probably used by our Lord, <i>Noono</i>, fish, the root
signifying <i>to be prolific</i>, for which fishes are eminently remarkable.
<i>Dag</i>, the Hebrew word, has the same original signification.</p>

<p>The word used by our Lord, in adverting to His descent to Hades, was
most probably that of the Syriac version,</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/image01.jpg" width="75" height="24" alt="[Syriac: noono]" />
</p>

<p class="noindent"> [Syriac](<i>noono</i>), which means
<i>fish</i> in Chaldee and Arabic, as well as in Syriac; and corresponds to
the Hebrew word &#1491;&#1463;&#1490;, (<i>dag</i>), <i>fish</i>, in
Jonah i.&nbsp;17., ii.&nbsp;1., 10. The Greek of Matthew xii.&nbsp;40., instead of
<span title="[Greek: ichthus]">&#7984;&#967;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span>, has
<span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>,
<i>a whale</i>. The Septuagint has the same word
<span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>
for (1) <i>dag</i> in Jonah, as well as for (2)
<i>leviathan</i> in Job iii. 8., and for (3) <i>tanninim</i> in Genesis i. 21. The
error appears to be in the Septuagint of Jonah, where the particular
fish, <i>the whale</i>, is mentioned instead of the general term <i>fish</i>.
Possibly the disciples of Christ knew that the fish was a
<span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>,
and the habits of such of them as were fishermen might have
familiarised them with its description or form. It is certain that the
<span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>
 of Aristotle, and <i>cetus</i> of Pliny, was one of the genus
<i>Cetacea</i>, without gills, but with blow-holes communicating with the
lungs. The disciples may also have heard the mythological story of
Hercules being three days in the belly of the
<span title="[Greek: kêtos]">&#954;&#8134;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>,
 the word
used by Æneas Gazæus, although Lycophron describes the animal as a
shark,
<span title="[Greek: karcharos kuôn]">&#954;&#8049;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#8059;&#969;&#957;</span>.</p>

<p>The remarkable event recorded of Jonah occurred just about 300 years
before Lycophron wrote; who, having doubtless heard the true story,
thought it right to attribute it to Hercules, to whom all other
marvellous feats of power, strength, and dexterity were appropriated by
the mythologists.</p>

<h3><span>ST. TRUNNIAN.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 187. 252.)</span></h3>

<p>Your "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" form the best specimen of a
Conversations-Lexicon that I have yet met with; and I regret that it was
not in existence some years ago, having long felt the want of some such
special and ready medium of communication.</p>

<p>In the old enclosures to the west of the town of Barton we had a spring
of clear water called St. Trunnian's Spring; and in our open field we
had an old thorn tree called St. Trunnian's Tree,&mdash;names that imply a
familiar acquaintance with St. Trunnian here; but I have no indication
to
<a id="show180"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[180]</span>
 show who St. Trunnian was. I am happy, however, to find that
your indefatigable correspondent D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. R<span class="smcap lowercase">IMBAULT</span>, like myself, has had his
attention called to the same unsatisfied Query.</p>

<p>Paulinus, the first Bishop of York, was the first who preached
Christianity in Lindsey; yet St. Chad was the patron saint of Barton and
its immediate neighbourhood, and at times I have fancied that St.
Trunnian might have been one of his coadjutors; at other times I have
thought he may have been some sainted person, posted here with the
allied force under Anlaff, previous to the great battle of Brunannburg,
which was fought in the adjoining parish in the time of Athelstan: but I
never could meet with any conclusive notice, of St. Trunnian, or any
particular account of him. Some years ago I was dining with a clerical
friend in London, and then made known my anxiety, when he at once
referred to the quotation made by D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. R<span class="smcap lowercase">IMBAULT</span> from <i>Appius and
Virginia</i>, as in Vol. iii., p. 187.; and my friend has since referred me
to Heywoods's play of <i>The Four P's</i> (Collier's edition of Dodsley's Old
Plays, vol. i. p. 55.), where the Palmer is introduced narrating his
pilgrimage:</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <p>   "At Saynt Toncumber and Saynt Tronion,</p>
    <p>  At Saynt Bothulph and Saynt Ann of Buckston;"</p>
</div>

<p>inferring a locality for St. Tronion as well as St. Botulph, in
Lincolnshire: and subsequently my friend notes that&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Mr. Stephens, in a letter to the printer of the <i>St. James's
   Chronicle</i>, points out the following mention of St. Tronion in
   Geoffrey Fenton's <i>Tragical Discourses</i>, 4to., 1567, fol. 114.
   b.:&mdash;'He (referring to some one in his narrative not named)
   returned in Haste to his Lodgynge, where he attended the approche
   of his Hower of appointment wyth no lesse Devocyon than the
   papystes in France perform their ydolatrous Pilgrimage to the
   ydol Saynt Tronyon upon the Mount Avyon besides Roan.'"</p>

<p>Should these minutes lead to further information, it will give me great
pleasure, as I am anxious to elucidate, as far as I can, the antiquities
of my native place.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaques lives at a place called St. Trinnians, near to Richmond in
Yorkshire; but I have not the <i>History of Richmondshire</i> to refer to, so
as to see whether any notice of our saint is there taken under this
evident variation of the same appellation.</p>

<h4><span><i>Lord Mayor not a Privy Councillor</i></span>
 <span>(Vol. iv., pp. 9. 137.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;L. M. says
that the precedent of Mr. Harley being sworn of the Privy Council does
not prove the argument advanced by C., and "for this simple reason, that
the individual who held the office is <i>not</i> Right Honorable, but the
officer <i>is</i>." What he means by the <i>office</i> (of privy councillor) is
not clear; but surely he does not mean to say that it is not the rank of
privy councillor which gives the courtesy style of Right Honorable? If
so, can a man be a member of the Council till he is <i>sworn</i> at the
board?</p>

<p>Is the Lord Mayor a member of the Board, not having been sworn? Is he
ever summoned to any Council? When he attends a meeting on the occasion
of the accession, is he <i>summoned</i>? and if so, by whom, and in what
manner? The Lord Mayor is certainly <i>not</i> a privy councillor by reason
of his courtesy <i>style</i> of Lord, any more than the Lord Mayor of York.</p>

<p>The question is, whether the style of Right Honorable was given to the
Lord Mayor from the supposition that he was a privy councillor, or from
the fact that formerly the Lord Mayor was considered as holding the rank
of a <i>Baron</i>; for if he died during his mayoralty, he was buried with
the rank, state, and degree of <i>Baron</i>.</p>

<p>When does it appear that the style of Right Honorable was first given to
the Lord Mayor of London?</p>

<h4><span><i>Did Bishop Gibson write a life of Cromwell?</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 117.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In
the Life of the Rev. Isaac Kimber, prefixed to his <i>Sermons</i>, London,
1756, 8vo., it is stated that&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"One of the first productions he gave to the world was the <i>Life
   of Oliver Cromwell</i> in 8vo., printed for Messrs. Brotherton and
   Cox. This piece met with a very good reception from the public,
   and has passed through several editions, universally esteemed for
   its style and its impartiality; and as the author's name was not
   made public, though it was always known to his friends, it was at
   first very confidently ascribed to Dr. Gibson, Bishop of
   London."&mdash;P. 10.</p>

<p>The Life of Kimber appears to have been written by Edward Kimber, his
son, and therefore the claim of Bishop Gibson to this work may very
fairly be set aside.</p>

<p>The <i>Short Critical Review of the life of Oliver Cromwell, by a
Gentleman of the Middle Temple</i>, has always been attributed to John
Bankes, an account of whom will be found in Chalmers's <i>Biog. Dict.</i>,
vol. iii. p. 422., where it is confidently stated to be his. It was
first published in 1739, 8vo. I have two copies of a third edition,
Lond. 1747. 12mo. "Carefully revised and greatly enlarged in every
chapter by the author." In one of the copies the title-page states it to
be "by a gentleman of the Middle Temple;" and in the other "by Mr.
Bankes." Bishop Gibson did not die till 1748, and there seems little
probability that, if he were the author, another man's name would be put
to it during his lifetime.</p>

<p>I conclude therefore that neither of these two works are by Bishop
Gibson.

<h4><span><i>Lines on the Temple</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iii., pp. 450. 505.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Gentleman's
Mag.</i> (Suppl. for 1768, p. 621.), the reviewer of a work entitled
"<i>Cobleriana, or the Cobler's Miscellany</i>, being a choice collection of
the miscellaneous pieces in prose and verse, serious and comic, by
Jobson the Cobler, of Drury Lane, 2 vols.," gives the following extract;
but does not state whether it belongs to the "new" pieces, or to those
which had been previously "published in the newspapers," the volume
being avowedly composed of both sorts:&mdash;</p>

     <div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
 <p>  "<i>An Epigram on the Lamb and Horse, the two insignia</i></p>
<p><i> of the Societies of the Temple.</i></p>
</div>

 <div class="stanza">
<p>"The Lamb the <i>Lawyers'</i> innocence declares,</p>
      <p> The Horse <i>their</i> expedition in affairs;</p>
       <p>Hail, happy men! for chusing two such types</p>
       <p>As plainly shew <i>they</i> give the world no wipes;</p>
      <p> For who dares say that suits are at a stand,</p>
     <p>  When <i>two</i> such virtues both go hand in hand?</p>
       <p>No more let <i>Chanc'ry Lane</i> be endless counted,</p>
       <p>Since they're by Lamb and Horse so nobly mounted."</p>
</div>

</div>


<p>The <i>Italics</i>, which I have copied, were, I suppose, put in by the
reviewer, who adds, "Q. Whether the Lamb and Horse are mounted upon
Chancery Lane, or two virtues, or happy men?" Poor man! I am afraid his
Query has never been answered; for that age was not adorned and
illustrated by any work like one in which we rejoice,&mdash;a work of which,
lest a more unguarded expression of our feelings should be indelicate,
and subject us to the suspicion of flattery, we will be content to say
boldly, that, though less in size and cost, it is cotemporaneous with
the Great Exhibition.</p>

<p>These lines are printed (probably for the first time) in the sixth
number of <i>The Foundling Hospital for Wit</i>, 8vo.: Printed for W. Webb,
near St. Paul's, 1749 (p. 73.). The learned author of <i>Heraldic
Anomalies</i> (2nd edit. vol. i. p. 310.) says they were <i>chalked</i> upon one
of the public gates of the Temple; but from the following note,
preceding the lines in question, in <i>The Foundling Hospital for Wit</i>,
this statement is probably erroneous:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The Inner Temple Gate, London, being lately repaired, and
   curiously decorated, the following inscription, in honour of both
   the Temples, is <i>intended</i> to be put over it."</p>


<p>A MS. note, in a cotemporary hand, in my copy of <i>The Foundling Hospital
for Wit</i>, states the author of the original lines to have been the "Rev.
William Dunkin, D.D." The answer which follows it, is said to be by "Sir
Charles Hanbury Williams."</p>

passion, never to be discountenanced again." The work of course is
become scarce, and not the less valuable, though that recommendation

the equinoxes; which space of time is calculated by Tycho Brahe at
25,816 years, and by Riccioli at 25,920: and I understood the passage
(whether rightly or wrongly I shall be glad to be informed) to mean,
that fifty years of life in Europe were better than any amount of
existence, however extended, in the Celestial Empire.</p>

<h4><span><i>Proof of Sword Blades</i></span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 39. 109.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Without wishing to
detract from the merits of an invention, which probably is superior in
its effects to old modes of testing sword blades, I object to the term
<i>efficient</i> being applied to <i>machine</i>-proved swords.</p>

<p>Because, after such proof, they frequently break by ordinary cutting;
even those which have been made doubly strong and heavy&mdash;and hence unfit
and useless for actual engagement&mdash;have so failed. And because
machine-tried swords are liable to, and do, break in the handle.</p>

<p>For many reasons I should condemn the machine in question as
inapplicable to its purposes. By analogous reasoning, it would not be
wrong to call a candle a good thrusting instrument, because a machine
may be made to force it through a deal plank.</p>

<p>The subject of testing sword blades is a very important one, although it
has not received that degree of attention from those whom it more nearly
concerns which it seems to demand.</p>

<p>The writer's experience has been only <i>en amateur</i>; but it has satisfied
him how much yet remains to be effected before swords proved by a
machine are to be relied upon.</p>

<h4><span><i>Was Milton an Anglo-Saxon Scholar?</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 100.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Is it too
much to suppose that the learned "Secretary for Forreigne Tongues" was
acquainted with the <i>Paraphrasis poetica Genesios ac præcipuarum sacræ
Paginæ Historiarum, abhinc Annos MLXX. Anglo-Saxonicè conscripta, et
nunc primum edita a Francisco Junius</i>, published at Amsterdam in 1655,
at least two years before he
<a id="before182"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[182]</span>
 commenced his immortal poem? Hear
Mr. Turner on the subject:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Milton could not be wholly unacquainted with Junius; and if he
   conversed with him, Junius was very likely to have made Cædmon
   the topic of his discourse, and may have read enough in English
   to Milton, to have fastened upon his imagination, without his
   being a Saxon scholar."&mdash;Turner's <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>, vol. iii., p.
   316.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Turner and Mr. Todd, however, appear to lean to the opinion
that Milton was not unskilled in Saxon literature, and mention, as an
argument in its favour, the frequent quotations from the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> which occur in the History. It is also worthy of note that
Alexander Gill, his schoolmaster, and whose friendship Milton possessed
in no small degree, had pursued his researches somewhat deep into the
"well of English undefiled," as appears from that extremely curious,
though little known work, the <i>Logonomia Anglica</i>.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Tradescants</i></span>

<p>&mdash;It is to be hoped that the
discovery by C. C. R. of Dr. Ducarel's note may yet lead to the
obtaining further information concerning the elder Tradescant. It may go
for something to prove beyond doubt that he was nearly connected with
the county of Kent, which has not been proved yet. Parkinson says that
"he sometimes belonged to ... Salisbury.... And then unto the Right
Honorable the Lord Wotton at Canterbury in Kent." See Parkinson's
<i>Paradisus Terrestris</i>, p. 152. (This must be the same with
 D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. R<span class="smcap lowercase">IMBAULT'S</span> Lord Weston, p. 353., which should have been "Wotton.") We
may therefore, in the words of Dr. Ducarel's note, "consult (with
certainty of finding information concerning the Tradescants) the
registers of &mdash;&mdash;apham, Kent." I should give the preference to any place
near Canterbury approaching that name.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that the deed of gift of John Tradescant (2) to
Elias Ashmole was dated in true astrological form, being "December 16,
1657, 5 hor. 30 minutes post merid." See Ashmole's <i>Diary</i>, p. 36.</p>

Note on this very epitaph, made several years since, from whence
extracted I know not; but there is an English version attached, which
may prove interesting to some readers, as it exactly imitates the style

<h4><span><i>Lady Petre's Monument</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 22.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Will the following passage,
from Murray's <i>Handbook to Southern Germany</i>, throw any light on the
meaning of the initials at the foot of Lady Petre's monument, as alluded
to in your Number of July 12, 1851?</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "At the extremity of the right-hand aisle of the cathedral of St.
   Stephen, is the marble monument of the Emperor Frederick III.,
   ornamented with 240 figures and 40 coats of arms, carved by a
   sculptor of Strasburg, Nicholas Lerch. On a scroll twisted around
   the sceptre in the hand of the effigy, is seen Frederick's device
   or motto, the letters A. E. I. O. U., supposed to be the initials
   of the words Alles Erdreich Ist Oesterreich Unterthan; or, in
   Latin, Austriæ Est Imperare Orbis Universi."&mdash;Murray's <i>Handbook
   to Southern Germany</i>, pp. 135, 136.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>Messrs. Longman have this month given a judicious and agreeable variety
to <i>The Traveller's Library</i> by substituting for one of Mr. Macaulay's
brilliant political biographies a volume of travels; and in selecting
Mr. Laing's <i>Journal of a Residence in Norway during the Years 1834,
1835, and 1836</i> (which is completed in Two Parts), they have shown
excellent discretion. For, as Mr. Laing well observes, "few readers of
the historical events of the middle ages rise from the perusal without a
wish to visit the country from which issued in the tenth century the men
who conquered the fairest portion of Europe." But as, even in these
locomotive times, all cannot travel, but many are destined to be not
only home-keeping youths but "house-keeping men" also, all such have
reason to be grateful to pleasant intelligent travellers like Mr. Laing
for giving
<a id="for183">&nbsp;</a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[183]</span>
them the results of their travels in so pleasant a
form; and especially grateful to Messrs. Longman for giving it to them
at a price which places it within the reach of every one.</p>

<p><i>The Literature of the Rail; republished, by permission, from</i> The Times
<i>of Saturday, August 9th, 1851, with a Preface</i>, has just been issued by
Mr. Murray, in the shape of a sixpenny pamphlet. This will be a
gratifying announcement to those who read and wished to preserve this
startling article on a subject which must come home to every thinking
mind,&mdash;to every one who has witnessed, as we have done, the worse than
worthless, the positively mischievous trash in the shape of literature
too often to be found on the bookstalls of railway stations. But there
is hope. The success which has attended the wholesome change effected on
the North-Western line is sure to lead to an extension of the better
system; and we are glad to see that the endeavours making by Messrs.
Longman to supply, by means of <i>The Traveller's Library</i>, the growing
want for <i>good and cheap</i> books, are to be seconded by Mr. Murray, who
announces a Series under the title of <i>Literature for the Rail</i>, and the
opening number of which is to be <i>A Popular Account of Mr. Layard's
Discoveries at Nineveh, abridged by himself from the larger Work, and
illustrated by numerous Woodcuts</i>.</p>

<p>We are glad to see that the Trustees of the British Museum have printed
a <i>List of the Autograph Letters, Original Charters, Great Seals, and
Manuscripts, exhibited to the Public in the Department of Manuscripts</i>.
The selection does great credit to the intelligent Keeper of the
Manuscripts; and the exhibition of these treasures will, we trust, do
something more than merely gratify the curiosity of the thousands of the
people who have visited them, namely, encourage their representatives in
Parliament to a more liberal vote for this important department of the
Museum. Valuable manuscripts are not always in the market; when they
are, the country should never lose them through a mistaken parsimony.</p>

<p>Mr. Lumley, of Chancery Lane, has purchased from the Society of
Antiquaries the remaining stock of the <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i>, and proposes
to dispose of the various plates and papers separately, in the same
manner as he did those of the <i>Archæologia</i>. This arrangement is one
well calculated to answer the purpose of collectors, and therefore we
desire to draw their attention to it.</p>

<p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell, on Tuesday and
Wednesday next, some very interesting Autograph Letters of the late John
Davies of Manchester, and of another Collector, comprising many Royal
Autographs; a series of interesting letters addressed to Elizabeth,
Queen of Bohemia; and some rare historical letters from the Southwell
and Blathwayte Papers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
